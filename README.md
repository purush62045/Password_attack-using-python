## 🔐 Password Brute Force Simulation in Python

This repository contains a Python script that simulates a brute-force password attack.  
It repeatedly generates random password combinations from a defined character set and compares them with a user-input password until a match is found.

### Features
- Supports digits, lowercase & uppercase letters, and special characters
- Counts total attempts
- Measures total execution time

### Purpose
This project is meant for learning and awareness only.  
It helps demonstrate why longer and more complex passwords are harder to crack.

⚠️ **Do not use this code for illegal or unethical activities.**
